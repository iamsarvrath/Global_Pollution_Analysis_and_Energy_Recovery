Global Pollution Analysis and Energy Recovery - Summary Report

Objective:
Analyze global pollution data, apply classification models (Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree), evaluate performance, and provide actionable insights.

Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values with median imputation.
- Label encoded categorical features.
- Standardized data using StandardScaler.

Model Evaluation:
1. Naive Bayes
   - Accuracy: 0.61
   - Simple, but assumes feature independence.
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Accuracy: 0.73
   - Improved performance with scaling.
3. Decision Tree
   - Accuracy: 0.78
   - Best performer; interpretable and accurate.

Key Findings:
- Strong correlation between renewable energy and pollution control.
- Decision Tree outperformed others.
- Naive Bayes struggled due to data assumptions.

Recommendations:
- Promote renewable energy use.
- Enhance data quality.
- Prefer Decision Trees for deployment.
- Always scale data for KNN-like models.

Files:
- Dataset: Global_Pollution_Analysis.csv
- Notebook: Contains preprocessing, models, and evaluations.
