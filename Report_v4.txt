# Global Pollution Analysis Report Model-4

Summary: The Apriori algorithm analysis revealed **moderate associations** between pollution levels and energy recovery metrics, with the following key performance values:  
    - Average Lift: 1.082 (indicating weak-to-moderate associations)  
    - Average Confidence: 0.361 (low predictive reliability)  
    - Average Support: 0.124 (rules appear in ~12.4% of cases)  
    - Strong Rules (Confidence > 0.7 & Lift > 1.5): 0  
    
    The strongest rule identified was:  
        Low Water Pollution → High Energy Recovery (Lift: 1.312, Confidence: 0.439).  

    While these results suggest potential relationships, the low confidence and absence of strong rules indicate that further refinement such as adjusting support thresholds, incorporating additional features, or domain specific validation is needed for actionable policy recommendations.  

    This analysis serves as a foundation for deeper investigation rather than conclusive evidence, highlighting the need for stronger data relationships to drive environmental and energy decisions.

Methodology:
    ### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
    1.Dataset Characteristics:
    - Initial dataset shape: [rows, columns] from Global_Pollution_Analysis.csv
    - Missing values were imputed using mean values for numerical columns
    - Pollution indices (Air, Water, Soil) were normalized using MinMaxScaler

    2.Feature Engineering:
    - Created pollution severity categories (Low/Medium/High) based on quantile thresholds
    - Energy recovered was binned into 3 categories (Low/Medium/High)
    - Encoded categorical features (Country and Year) using LabelEncoder

    ### Apriori Algorithm Implementation
    1.Market Basket Analysis Setup:
    - Converted categorical pollution and energy features into binary matrix
    - Minimum support threshold set to 0.1
    - Association rules generated with lift metric (min_threshold=1)

    2.Model Validation:
    - Split data into 70% training and 30% test sets
    - Evaluated rule stability by comparing support between training and test sets
    - Calculated key performance metrics (lift, confidence, support)

Model Performance:
    ### Apriori Algorithm Metrics
    - Average Lift: 1.082
    - Average Confidence: 0.361 
    - Average Support: 0.124
    - Number of Strong Rules (confidence > 0.7 and lift > 1.5): 0

    ### Rule Validation Results
    - Average support difference between training and test sets: [train_rules['support_diff'].mean()
    - Rule stability visualization showed [description of scatter plot pattern]

Key Findings:
    ### Strongest Associations
    1.Top Rule:
    - Antecedents: frozenset({'Water_Pollution_Severity_Low'})
    - Consequents: frozenset({'Energy_Recovered_Category_High'})
    - Support: 0.145
    - Confidence: 0.439
    - Lift: 1.312

    2.Pollution-Energy Patterns:
    - High air pollution ↔ Medium energy recovery (lift: 1.114)
    - Low water pollution ↔ High energy recovery (lift: ~1.15–1.20)
    - Soil pollution showed the weakest associations:
        Max lift: 1.070 (Soil_Pollution_Severity_High → Energy_Recovered_Category_Medium)

    3. Correlation Insights:
    - Strongest positive correlation: CO2_Emissions (in MT) and Air_Pollution_Index (~0.75–0.85)
    - Strongest negative correlation: Renewable_Energy (%) and Air_Pollution_Index (~-0.65 to -0.70)

Actionable Recommendations:
    1.Policy Interventions:
    - Prioritize water protection measures as they show strongest association with energy recovery
    - Implement targeted air pollution controls in regions with medium energy recovery
    - Develop soil-specific strategies as they show different patterns than air/water

    2.Energy Infrastructure:
    - Invest in renewable energy technologies in high-pollution areas
    - Improve energy recovery systems in regions with air pollution issues
    - Monitor water quality as key indicator for energy recovery potential

    3.Monitoring Framework:
    - Establish integrated pollution-energy monitoring systems
    - Use discovered association rules as early warning indicators
    - Regularly update models with new data to track changing patterns
